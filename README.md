This repository contains a LangChain demo that ties together an LLM with document retrieval and a notebook demonstrating how the pipeline works. The main artifact is app_langchain.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook). The goal of this repo is to be easy to run and visually explain what the project does.

# Features
- Simple LangChain retrieval + generation pipeline example
- Example prompt templates and chains

# Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- LangChain
- OpenAI API Key (optional: Hugging Face or Ollama for open-source models)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code for development
